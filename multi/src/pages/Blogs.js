        <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
        <p>
            Here at Celebrity Beefs, we strive to show the world that fighting
            amongst celebrities really isn't something to be interested in.
            There are many other things that you can be doing with your time
            other than by reading/watching some celebrities fight over something
            someone said or did that is insignificant in the long run. We strive
            to help you bring actual joy in your life through various methods other
            than that we present here.
        </p>
